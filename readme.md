# LeetCodeWhy

Teach you how to solve problems on LeetCode, and learn the key of algorithm.

### Time-space complexity

Time-space complexity is a concept that used to measure a performance of a algorithm. When size of a data collection increased, the cost will increase. 

The analyse of a algorithm is not depend on running enviornment, for example, we don't consider how fast your computer is.
